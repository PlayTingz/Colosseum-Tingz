# Colosseum-Tingz
Gaming’s no-code moment is one prompt away. Tingz lets anyone create playable AI-generated games from simple text prompts. We’re making game creation fast, fun, and open to everyone — now bringing it on-chain with Solana.

This Project contains the logic for Minting NFTs from what is generated from Tingz. This uses Metaplex SDK.

https://github.com/PlayTingz/unity-mcp needs to be installed and set up in the project for Tingz MCP to create assets.

https://github.com/PlayTingz/Client is the Tingz client that can be used to launch prompts from our interface, instead of utilizing third-party tools like Claude Desktop. This will be expanded with supporting many different LLMs from one iterface.
